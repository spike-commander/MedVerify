# Hospital Bill Recognition Site Walkthrough

I have successfully created **MedVerify**, a premium web platform designed to provide transparency for hospital billing based on government-mandated rates (CGHS/PM-JAY).

## Key Features

1.  **Bill Verification**: Users can enter a hospital bill number (e.g., `BILL-101`) to automatically recognize the treatment and compare hospital charges against government rates.
2.  **Price Transparency Grid**: A searchable list of common treatments with their government-mandated prices and typical private hospital savings.
3.  **Premium Design**: A modern, glassmorphic UI with animated background blobs, responsive layouts, and smooth transitions.

## Files Created

- [index.html](file:///f:/HOSPITAL-BILL-RECOGNITION/index.html): Main structure with glassmorphic components.
- [styles.css](file:///f:/HOSPITAL-BILL-RECOGNITION/styles.css): Premium styling and animations.
- [app.js](file:///f:/HOSPITAL-BILL-RECOGNITION/app.js): Core interactive logic and embedded treatment data.
- [data.json](file:///f:/HOSPITAL-BILL-RECOGNITION/data.json): Mock data for bills and prices.

## How to Use

1.  Open [index.html](file:///f:/HOSPITAL-BILL-RECOGNITION/index.html) in any modern web browser.
2.  To test bill recognition, enter **BILL-101**, **BILL-102**, or **BILL-103**.
3.  Use the "Treatment Rates" section to search for specific procedures like "Heart" or "Appendectomy".
